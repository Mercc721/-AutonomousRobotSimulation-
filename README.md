# Autonomous Robot Simulation

This is a 2D autonomous robot simulation built with Python and Pygame. The robot navigates a map using simulated LiDAR sensors and performs intelligent obstacle avoidance. It also wraps around screen edges for continuous navigation.

## Features
- 360° LiDAR scanning
- Obstacle avoidance
- Adjustable speed, rotation, and avoidance threshold
- Collision detection using polygon-to-rectangle masking
- Wrap-around navigation

## Controls
- W/S: Increase/decrease speed
- A/D: Increase/decrease rotation speed
- Q/E: Adjust avoidance threshold

## Skills
Python, Pygame, Robotics Simulation, Autonomous Navigation
